# Watchlist Data Loading Fix

## 🐛 Critical Bug Found and Fixed

### The Problem:
The WatchlistRepository was calling the **wrong endpoint**: `/api/user/me` instead of `/api/me`

This caused a 404 error when trying to load your subscriptions, making the watchlist appear empty.

### The Fix:
**File Modified**: `lib/data/watchlist/watchlist_repository_impl.dart:50`

**Changed From**:
```dart
final response = await _dio.get('/api/user/me');
```

**Changed To**:
```dart
print('📋 Fetching watchlist from /api/me');
final response = await _dio.get('/api/me');
```

### Additional Improvements:
Added debug logging to track watchlist loading:
- `📋 Fetching watchlist from /api/me` - When request starts
- `📋 Watchlist loaded: X subscriptions` - On success
- `📋 Failed to fetch watchlist: X` - On HTTP error
- `📋 Watchlist fetch error: X` - On network error

## 🚀 What You Need To Do:

### **Hot Restart Required**
Since this is a repository-level change, you need a **full restart**:

1. **Stop the app** - Press `q` in terminal
2. **Clean build** (recommended):
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. **Restart**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### **Expected Results After Restart**:

When you navigate to the **Watchlist** tab, you should now see:

#### In Console Logs:
```
📋 Fetching watchlist from /api/me
📋 Watchlist loaded: X subscriptions
📦 Fetching all products from API
📦 Fetched Y products
```

#### On Screen:
- **"Discover Products" tab**: All available products with subscribe/unsubscribe toggles
- **"My Subscriptions" tab**: Only the products you're currently subscribed to

## ✅ Other Screens Status:

### Monitor/Dashboard Tab:
- **Should work** - Uses different endpoint (`/api/alerts/recent`)
- **Look for**: 🔔 emoji in logs

### History Tab:
- **Should work** - Uses `/api/alerts/history`
- **Look for**: 📊 emoji in logs

### Settings Screens:
- **Should work** - All use `/api/me` which is correct
- **Look for**: 📝 emoji in logs for preference updates

## 🔍 Verification Steps:

After restart, please check:

1. **Watchlist loads your subscriptions**
   - Navigate to Watchlist → My Subscriptions
   - Should show products you're subscribed to (based on your user profile which has 200+ productSkus)

2. **Can view all products**
   - Navigate to Watchlist → Discover Products
   - Should show all available products from the backend

3. **Subscribe/Unsubscribe works**
   - Click the toggle on any product
   - Note: Subscribe endpoints may still return 404 (separate issue - see below)

## ⚠️ Known Remaining Issues:

### Subscribe/Unsubscribe Endpoints (404 Error)
**Endpoints trying to use**:
- `POST /api/products/subscribe/:sku`
- `POST /api/products/unsubscribe/:sku`

**Status**: These endpoints return 404

**Impact**: You can view your subscriptions but cannot add/remove them from the app

**Workaround**: Subscriptions can be managed through the backend/admin panel

**Next Steps**: Need to verify correct endpoint paths with backend team

## 📊 Your Current Subscriptions:

Based on the API test, your account has **200+ product subscriptions**, including:
- Pokemon cards (various SKUs)
- Target products
- Walmart products
- Amazon products
- And many more

All of these should now be visible in the "My Subscriptions" tab!
